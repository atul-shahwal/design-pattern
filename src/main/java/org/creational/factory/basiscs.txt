Factory Design Pattern or Factory Method Design patterns

when there is a superclass and subclasses, and we want to get object of subclasses based on input and requirement.
Then we create Factory class which takes the responsibility of creating object of the class based on input.

Advantages of Factory Design Pattern

1.Focus on creating object for interface rather than implementation
2.Loose coupling more robust code
