Iterator Design Pattern.
we use always eg- we use collection framework.
the iterator design pattern provides a way to access the elements of an object without exposing its underlying implementation.

when we create a class and inside that class we store collection of objects
    eg- Class contains list of users we use iterator to traverse user
    inside Iterator design pattern we have an Interface containing two methods
    hasNext()--boolean
    nex()--to move to nex index
