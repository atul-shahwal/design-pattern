/**
 * ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement: FizzBuzz Multithreaded
 *
 * This is a classic concurrency problem where four threads need to print the numbers
 * from 1 to n in a specific order:
 * - Thread 1 prints "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
 * - Thread 2 prints "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
 * - Thread 3 prints "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
 * - Thread 4 prints the number itself for all other cases.
 * The core challenge is coordinating the threads to ensure the output is in the correct sequence.
 *
 * âœ… Approach: Semaphore-based Coordination
 *
 * We use a set of Semaphores to control the flow of execution.
 * - The 'number' thread acts as the central coordinator, or "leader."
 * - It acquires a semaphore and then decides which of the other three threads should proceed next
 * by releasing the appropriate semaphore.
 * - Each of the other threads ('fizz', 'buzz', 'fizzbuzz') waits for its specific semaphore to be released
 * before printing its output.
 *
 * ðŸ“¦ Key Components:
 * - `n`: The limit for the FizzBuzz sequence.
 * - `numberSemaphore`: Acts as the initial gate, allowing the coordinator to proceed.
 * - `fizzSemaphore`, `buzzSemaphore`, `fizzBuzzSemaphore`: Permits for the "worker" threads,
 * initialized to zero, so they start in a blocked state.
 *
 * ðŸš€ Example Flow:
 * 1. The 'number' thread acquires its permit.
 * 2. It checks the number 'i' and releases a permit for the correct worker thread (e.g., 'fizzbuzz').
 * 3. The 'fizzbuzz' thread wakes up, acquires its permit, prints "FizzBuzz", and then
 * releases the `numberSemaphore` to signal the coordinator to continue to the next number.
