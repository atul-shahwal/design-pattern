/**
 * ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement: Dining Philosophers
 *
 * This is a classic concurrency problem to illustrate the dangers of deadlock and starvation.
 * The goal is to design a protocol where five philosophers, who need two forks to eat,
 * can do so without getting stuck in a circular wait (deadlock).
 *
 * âœ… Requirements:
 * - Prevent deadlock, where no philosopher can proceed.
 * - Ensure fairness and prevent starvation, where a philosopher can never eat.
 * - The solution must be thread-safe.
 *
 * ðŸ“¦ Key Components:
 * - A main Semaphore to limit concurrent access.
 * - An array of Semaphores, one for each fork.
 * - The 'wantsToEat' method that encapsulates the eating protocol.
 *
 * ðŸš€ Example Flow:
 * 1. A philosopher wants to eat and acquires a permit from the main semaphore.
 * 2. They acquire their left and right forks (semaphores).
 * 3. They eat, then release both forks.
 * 4. They release the permit from the main semaphore, allowing another philosopher to proceed.
