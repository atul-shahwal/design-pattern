Builder Design Pattern.(Lombok etc.)

While creating Object when object contains many attributes there are many problems that exists:
    1.we have to pass many arguments to create object(parameters order may be hard to remember if there are too many)
    2.Some parameter might be optional
    3.factory class takes all responsibility for creating object. if the object as heavy as all complexity is the part of factory class.
So in Builder pattern we create object step by step and finally return the final object with desired values of attributes

builder pattern also helps a lop while creating immutable objects
