/**
 * ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement: Low-Level Design - ATM System
 *
 * Design an ATM system that handles user authentication, transaction processing, and cash dispensing.
 * The system should manage multiple states (idle, card inserted, PIN validated, etc.), validate user inputs,
 * and handle cash inventory securely and efficiently.
 *
 * âœ… Requirements:
 * - Support card insertion and PIN validation.
 * - Allow cash withdrawal and balance inquiry transactions.
 * - Manage cash inventory with different denominations.
 * - Handle state transitions smoothly (idle â†’ has card â†’ transaction â†’ idle).
 * - Ensure secure authentication and transaction processing.
 *
 * ðŸ“¦ Key Components:
 * - Card and Account classes for user data and validation.
 * - ATMInventory for cash denomination management.
 * - ATMState interface and concrete states (IdleState, HasCardState, etc.).
 * - ATMMachine class to orchestrate operations and state transitions.
 *
 * ðŸš€ Example Flow:
 * 1. User inserts card â†’ system transitions to HasCardState.
 * 2. User enters PIN â†’ system validates and moves to SelectOperationState.
 * 3. User selects withdrawal â†’ system processes transaction in TransactionState.
 * 4. If successful, cash is dispensed, and card is ejected â†’ system returns to IdleState.

/**
 * CashType represents the available denominations in the ATM.

 * â–¶ Cross Questions:
 * Q1: Why use an enum for denominations instead of constants?
 * A1: Enums provide type safety and are easier to maintain, especially when more denominations are added.
 *
 * Q2: Why store the value as an instance field?
 * A2: It allows easy access to the denomination value for calculations like inventory and dispensing.

 * â–¶ Cross Questions:

 *
 * Q2: How would you enhance security if scaling this application?
 * A2: Implement encryption for PINs, use secure storage mechanisms, and apply multi-factor authentication.
